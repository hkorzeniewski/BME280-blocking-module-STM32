# STM32F429-smarthome-control

Device based on microcontroler STM32F429 discovery which can automate simply household activities such as temperature control, stepper, led (brightness, different modes) etc.
To control some features it uses interfaces such as I2C, SPI, USART, PWM. Code is written in STM32CubeIDE
